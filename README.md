# VoiceRemind - Voice-First Reminder App

**Status: Early Access - Working with Voice and AI Features**

Create reminders using your voice or AI-powered text generation. Speak naturally or type casually and let AI understand what you want to remember.

## What VoiceRemind Does

**AI Text:** Type "Remind me to call mom tomorrow at 3pm and buy groceries tonight"  
**VoiceRemind:** Creates two separate reminders with correct dates and times

**Voice Input:** Say "Meeting with John next Tuesday at 3 PM"  
**VoiceRemind:** Understands your speech and creates a properly scheduled reminder

The app works by using AI to understand natural language and create smart reminders from your speech or text.

## Current Status
